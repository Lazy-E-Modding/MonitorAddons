# Monitor Addons
Expand the experience with custom monitors to add to your tractors and other vehicles for FS22. 
## Information

The Monitor Addon Pack from Lazy E Modding currently includes:
- John Deere BaleTrak Monitor
- Intercomp Weight Monitor

This addon Pack is more of a prefab than a mod and should be treated as such. To make this pack work you’ll need to follow the instructions provided. **Lazy E Modding will not provide support for installing the monitors** as it’s intended to be done by modders who know how to install a simple edit without needing to be walked through step by step. 

## Installation instructions
1. Download [DBL from Modhub](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=us&mod_id=264698&title=fs2022), or a development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/jason0611/FS22_DashboardLive)
2. Download the [Release Assets]() from this GitHub Repo.
3. Position the monitors included in the release package into your vehicle in Giant’s Editor. If you’d like to put them on a mount, you’ll have to add them yourself as no mounts are included in the release package. The clamps on the back of the monitors are intended to use 0.75” (19mm) diameter poles.
4. Make note of the monitor nodes (index path) for future reference. Should look something like "0>0|5|10|0|2|0|0|0|0" depending on where you put the monitor at. These can be found on the "Attributes" window in GIANTS Editor. ![Screenshot of GIANTS Editor](https://github.com/Lazy-E-Modding/MonitorAddons/blob/c6f63f9222abd320e9ba4457211ffc8fd7f3a38d/Screenshot%202023-08-30%20121448.jpg)
